    \n<big><b>NoiseAlert</b> travel baby monitor</big>\n
    \n
    In combination with a second phone, NoiseAlert can turn an Android cellphone into an improvised baby monitor.
    When running, NoiseAlert monitors the surrounding noise level through the microphone and if the noise exceeds a
    configured threshold for more than a few seconds, it calls a pre-configured number.\n
    \n
    <b>Usage</b>\n
    In order to use NoiseAlert, first configure the correct alert phone number to be called in \"Settings->
    Alert Phone Number\" and test that it will indeed ring the right phone, but selecting \"Panic\" from the menu.
    Then turn down the ringer volume until it switches into silent mode, to avoid incoming ring or alerts
    setting off the monitor - or disturb a sleeping baby. The place the monitor at a safe distance, but in the
    same room with the sleeping child, dog or whatever it is you are trying to monitor. Ideally put the phone on
    charger, since running the monitor will keep the phone awake. If necessary use the \"Test\" menu option to verify
    that the current ambient noise level does not set off the alert and if possibly adjust the threshold in
    \"Settings->Sound Threshold\". The choose \"Start\" from the menu and verify that the red monitoring light
    is blinking on the display before leaving the room.\n
    \n
    The monitor will automatically de-activate itself after an alert has been triggered or if the user navigates
    away from the main screen, while the monitor is running. The monitor can also be de-activated using the
    \"Stop\" option from the menu.\n
    \n
    <b>Warning</b>\n
    Please be aware that cellphone service can be unreliable at times, this application or the phone in general
    could easily malfunction. It should only be used when such failures can be tolerated without causing any
    serious danger.\n
    Please be also aware that there is a reason why commercial wireless baby monitors only have a short enough
    reach, that you would not really need them. Before going to far from an unattended child, always consider
    some worst-case scenario like fire breaking out in the building or a power outage. Depending on the situation,
    only go as far as you could get back very quickly in any situation, e.g. even if the elevators are no
    longer working.\n
 	\n
 	<b>SMS remote control</b> (experimental only)\n
 	By setting a \"secret\" password code in \"Settings->SMS Remote Security Code\", you can activate a limited
 	SMS based remote control function which is active only when the application is running. If you send an SMS to
 	the phone, starting with the security code, followed by either of the commands \"start\", \"stop\", \"panic\",
 	the equivalent menu command is executed.
