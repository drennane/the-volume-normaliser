# The Volume Normaliser
Android App that automatically adjusts your TV volume

<b>Put away your remote</b>

Getting sick of the loud adverts or news reports when your dozing off in bed with the TV on?
Wouldn't it be cool if something just "looked after" this problem for you..?
Introducing, the Volume Normaliser

<b>Usage</b>

The following steps outline how to get this simple app doing what it does
Start the app
From the setting menu, choose your TV maker (Sony/Samsung/LG etc)
Using the app, set your desired volume but only when watching the programme you wish to view, do not do so during an ad break or news report.
Hit the "lock level" button and let the app do the rest.

<b>The science</b>

The application spends a set period of time sampling the ambient noise the room. It uses the devices microphone to achieve this. Obviously, if there is any other noise in the room at the time of sampling, the sampling will be flawed as an appropriate
ambient level will not be properly determined. 
So, in other words, wait until she's finished drying her hair before use.

Enjoy!
